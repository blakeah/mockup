home.intro=The Medkit (alternative spellings Med Kit, Healthkit, Health Kit) is a healing item, often found scattered around high-risk areas where immediate medical attention might be needed to prevent death.  Similar to its counterpart in Half-Life, the Medkit has a predominantly white coloring and is labeled with a red medical cross. Its appearance is overall similar to other such medical devices, making it easily identifiable; it also features the Caduceus, a symbol commonly used as a symbol of medicine. Whereas in Half-Life the Medkits are apparently manufactured by Black Mesa, these are produced by the Combine.

headline.message.1=The Black Mesa Medical Module (Medkit), is a medkit used by the medical departments of Black Mesa. When the Device is held near a person that person will show up on the screen of the Medkit, with 5 different body parts (Head, Chest, Left Leg, Right Leg, Left Arm, Right Arm). The body parts will appear in a different color depending on the medical condition of that part, the greener it is the better, the redder it is the worse, Once you select a body part the Medkit will begin healing that part, but don't expect it to heal a decapitated arm or something. The Medkit uses a special kind of battery's designed by Black Mesa called "BM+" battery's, it uses like 1 battery to heal a body part and can hold a maximum of 5 battery's.
headline.message.2=A smaller variant healing less damage to the Combine Medkit is the health vial. Often dropped from Overwatch Soldiers upon their death, health vials can be convenient during battles when other supplies of health cannot be found.  Both the Medkit and health vial contain what appears to be raw flesh suspended in green liquid, looking like the liquid in scientists' syringes from Half-Life, presumably the material used for healing.
