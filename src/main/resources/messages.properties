home.intro=The Medkit (alternative spellings Med Kit, Healthkit, Health Kit) is a healing item, often found scattered around high-risk areas where immediate medical attention might be needed to prevent death.  Similar to its counterpart in Half-Life, the Medkit has a predominantly white coloring and is labeled with a red medical cross. Its appearance is overall similar to other such medical devices, making it easily identifiable; it also features the Caduceus, a symbol commonly used as a symbol of medicine. Whereas in Half-Life the Medkits are apparently manufactured by Black Mesa, these are produced by the Combine.
